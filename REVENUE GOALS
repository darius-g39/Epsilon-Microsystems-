REVENUE GOALS FOR THIS COMPANY (Q4 2025, Q1 2026)

2025

Q4 2025: $0-$500
BECAUSE IT MAY BE TOO EARLY, AND REVENUE MIGHT COME ONLY FROM
THE BLOG AND THE MAIN WEBSITE IN DECEMBER, AND SELLING INDUSTRY NEWS
PLUS ME TAKING ON CODING FREELANCE GIGS IN FORMS OF WORDPRESS THEMES
BECAUSE THOSE WOULD MAKE SENSE FOR NOW AT NOT MANY SKILLS

THE BLOG WILL BE LAUNCHED WITH GTM NEWSLETTER

I WILL LEARN UX MINIMAL AND
IN THIS QUARTER I WILL SPEEDRUN HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT AND TRY
TO BUILD A FIRST WEBSITE FOR MY MAIN COMPANY

2026

Q1 2026 : $15,000-$20,580
OFFERING NEWS ON SEMICONDUCTORS COULD BE A REVENUE SOURCE IN GENERAL
BUT I WON'T COUNT ON IT AS IT IS NON TECHNICAL AS FOR Q1 2026 AND
I WOULD SELL GENERAL STUFF AND ARTICLES

I WILL TRY TO GET A LOAN FROM THE BANK TO EXPAND THE BUSINES S4.613 USD, AND HIRE DESIGNERS 
PLUS PROVIDE A 10 MONTH RUNAWAY FOR EXPENSES AND CONTINUE TO SCALE 

THE PRICE FOR PREMIUM NEWS WILL BE A UNIVERSAL SUBSCRIPTION FOR MY COMPANY
ABOUT $49/mo FOR EVERYTHING IN THE 2026 EARLY BIRD DISCOUNT.

IF 200 SIGN UP, THE REVENUE COULD BE DECENT, BUT THE ACTUAL FIGURE COULD BE MUCH 
LOWER.

WEB DEVELOPMENT WILL CONTINUE, AS THIS COULD BE THE BEST REVENUE SOURCE
+ CONTINUING UX ON THE WEBSITE

ALSO IN Q1 2026 I AM INTERESTED IN GROWING OPEN SOURCE, AND HIRING ON UPWORK
