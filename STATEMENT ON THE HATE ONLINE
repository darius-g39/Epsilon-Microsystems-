Most of these people on Reddit, don't even know the power of what open source and trying your best to do a project.
Just take a look at this link whoever is coming ever here:
"https://www.reddit.com/r/ElectricalEngineering/comments/1nwx0d4/do_i_have_to_go_to_college_ee_if_i_started_a/"

ASKED IF I SHOULD GO TO COLLEGE, because I am young embarking on this process. And will take many years and the comments were
completely out of touch with reality. Instead of offering help and ideas, they turned to hate. The truth is that Reddit is a big
echo chamber and I strongly suggest everyone who asks questions about their projects there, to no longer ask them.

For example, one user makes himself as the big expert as he had ever done this kind of project. Spewing hate and so called advice, I won't
mention it here, but you can see him in the thread schooling me, while never taking action on these kinds of projects.

Most of them have no idea about how actual industry players started, and they started via collaboration and working together
even with little capital. First of all, they should do their homework before giving advice.

It will take 5 years, maybe 10 years, but I am sure I can build a company.

As the saying goes. The journey of 1000 miles starts with a single step
